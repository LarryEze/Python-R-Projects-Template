Working with categorical data is an essential skill as a data analyst or data scientist. This template will teach you how to inspect, create, filter, and aggregate categorical variables.\n\nThis tutorial will use Summer Olympics data. You are free to create an integration to your data set or use another existing integration. You can learn more about integrations [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/integrations/what-is-an-integration).\n\n_Note: The databases from different PostgreSQL courses are available in the Course Databases database. You can click the \"Browse tables\" button in the upper righthand corner of the cell below to view the available schemas and tables. The data used for this workspace is contained in the medals schema. To access each table, you need to specify this schema in your queries (e.g., medals.summer_medals for the summer_medals table)._","metadata":{},"id":"acf929b3-ca35-48e0-adfc-fad5ab49aa0c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Inspecting categorical variables\n\nOften, you will want to know the unique values in a categorical column.

keyword with the `WHERE` clause. There are two wildcards you can use when defining a pattern.\n- The `%` wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters.\n- The `_` wildcard will match a single character.\nIn the query below, we enclose \"Team\" with two `%` wildcards to return all rows where the `event` contains \"Team\" (whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end). You can learn more about pattern matching in [this exercise](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql/filtering-rows?ex=12) of [Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql).\n\n_Note: This string matching will be case-sensitive. If you want to make your search case insensitive, you can use `ILIKE` instead of `LIKE`._","metadata":{},"id":"a8f467dc-0b5e-46c2-a024-9bb1bab9c269","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT *\nFROM

You can create a categorical variable using a CASE statement. \n\nA `CASE` statement has the following structure: \n    \n    CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <value> ELSE <alternative_value> END AS <column_name>\n- The first `WHEN` specifies a condition.\n- `THEN` specifies the value if the condition is met.\n- `ELSE` returns an alternate value if the condition is not met.\n- `END` finishes the case statement, after which you can use `AS` to alias the column.\n\nIn the query below, we create a new categorical variable called `event_type` based on whether the `event` column contains individual or team events. You can learn more about creating categorical variables
