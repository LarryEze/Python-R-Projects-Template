You cannot use the train data again for this, since this will give you an overestimate of its performance on new data. However, you can solve this by training the model on a portion of the data (~70%) and evaluate its performance on the rest. These are called the training set and test set respectively. This recipe tells you how you can do this using the scikit-learn's `train_test_split()` function.","metadata":{},"id":"8417ac1e-70f9-4cb9-9615-06969f1dccd2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Load
